However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\"\n\nHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Slam Dunk won the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category in 1994.

When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\n\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness.

Having to sell his personal items to make ends meet, Kusonoki is offered the chance to sell his lifespan to earn some money. But it is revealed he could part ways with his remaining 30 years of life at a paltry rate—which means that he will never find happiness in this life. Rather than endure misery, Kusonoki decides to sell his life expectancy, leaving him with three months to live.\n\nFeeling liberated from social norms, he sets a series of goals for himself, one of which is to clarify his feelings for his childhood friend Himeno. Meanwhile, Miyagi, the clerk who bought his lifespan, is sent to monitor his activities in the case that Kusunoki may exhibit anti-social behavior. Although annoyed by Miyagi's constant presence, Kusunoki will do everything he can to find a purpose to his existence in the remaining time that he has left.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mikkakan no Koufuku began as a web novel posted on the message board 2channel under the title Jumyou wo Kaitotte Moratta.
